# hey welcome to this where i put all my krunker related stuff

i have released a [mod](https://krunker.io/?mod=dj62ware), css, and that css looks optimal with [my settings](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628964831529140254/959173453460680704/dj62ware_settings.txt) (or similar settings, it's just about the charge bar and speed thing and medals etc etc)

## dj62ware css

this css was made by me even tho i took some bits of code from other css's
check releases tab for downloading the non-import version

this css aims at staying true to the original while still improving it, with changes such as
- class selector on main screen
- dark mode
- health and ammo in game are better positioned
- and probably more
