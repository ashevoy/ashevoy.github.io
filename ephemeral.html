								Well well well this project started forever ago now damn.
							</p>
							<p>
								It all started in april of 2022, back when i 
								was freshly level 100. I tried quite 
								a bunch of different CSSes made by people 
								in the community. And as much as some of 
								them were really nice, they were just 
								not enough for me.
							</p>	
							<p>
								So, with absolutely NO 
								prior css experience, i was like "Hey, fuck it, 
								i'm making a css, i don't even know how this 
								shit works, but i WILL do it". <em>(which you 
								can probably tell if you look at the code that 
								sometimes i was fucking clueless about it. 
								maybe one day i'll clean it all up, but for 
								now it worksTM.)</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								The name of the CSS was originally dj62ware, 
								like my old mod, but i quickly realised that
								both my mod and my CSS having the same name
								would be rather confusing. So i decided to
								change its name to Ephemeral. It comes from 
								a song i was listening to a lot back when 
								i was working on it at first, 
								<em>Ephemeral</em> by Geoxor. It's also
								a word i think sounds really beautiful in 
								terms of sonority.

								<p>
								<strong>To install a CSS on a Krunker client</strong>, you need to drag it into the "css" folder of your 
								resource swapper. If you aren't sure where it is, or what that even means in 
								the first place, continue reading.<br>
								<strong>If you're on windows</strong>, it should be in "My PC", then "Documents", then
								"<em>the name of your client</em>". From here, if you see a folder called
								something along the lines of "swapper", enter it. If you don't, stay in the same folder.<br>
								Now, that you are in your client's folder or your swapper folder depending 
								on the case, you should create a folder called "css" (if it doesn't already exist) by right
								clicking. Then, drag the downloaded file into your css folder and tadaaa.
								Make sure to double check if the resource swapper is enabled in your client's settings, 
								it is often off by default on most clients.<br><br>
								<strong>If you're on mac</strong>, the process should be similar in the finder.
								<br><br>
								If you want to <strong>install the CSS on your browser</strong>, try installing 
								<a class="intextLnk" target="_blank" href=https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne>Stylus</a>, a free 
								extension that lets you add your own custom css rules to a page. Just click the extension, then tick 
								"write style for krunker..", copy the entire CSS and paste it into the extension window, then click save
								at the left of the screen. You should normally have a functional CSS.
								<br><br>If you are still struggling, try looking up tutorials on youtube, there are plenty
								that should explain it perfectly. Don't forget to specify the client/browser you're using.
								</p>
							</details>

							<p class="lilP">please note that the steam client isn't supported and i am not planning on supporting it. and besides,
								if you still use it in 2025, i would highly advise you to change clients for something with better functionality
								like Crankshaft or PC7.
							</p>

							<h3 class="drSh">PC7 Client</h3>

							<p>PC7 is the most popular client nowadays on Krunker. It isn't the one I personally
								use but I would still recommend it to people as it has quite a lot of features,
								including many built-in CSSes. Ephemeral is one of them :3
							</p>
							<p class="lilP">please note that you do get less customisability options when loading it through
								pc7's easyCSS, but if you weren't planning on changing the defaults then this'll work perfectly for you.
