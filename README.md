## dj62ware css

this css was made by me even tho i took some bits of code from other css's
check releases tab for downloading the non-import version

this css aims at staying true to the original while still improving it, with changes such as
- class selector on main screen
- dark mode
- health and ammo in game are better positioned
- and probably more
