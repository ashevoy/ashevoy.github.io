						<p>
							Well well well this project started forever ago now damn.
						</p>
						<p>
							It all started in april of 2022, back when i 
							was freshly level 100. I tried quite 
							a bunch of different CSSes made by people 
							in the community. And as much as some of 
							them were really nice, they were just 
							not enough for me.
						</p>	
						<p>
							So, with absolutely NO 
							prior css experience, i was like "Hey, fuck it, 
							i'm making a css, i don't even know how this 
							shit works, but i WILL do it". <em>(which you 
							can probably tell if you look at the code that 
							sometimes i was fucking clueless about it. 
							maybe one day i'll clean it all up, but for 
							now it worksTM.)</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							The name of the CSS was originally dj62ware, 
							like my old mod, but i quickly realised that
							both my mod and my CSS having the same name
							would be rather confusing. So i decided to
							change its name to Ephemeral. It comes from 
							a song i was listening to a lot back when 
							i was working on it at first, 
							<em>Ephemeral</em> by Geoxor. It's also
							a word i think sounds really beautiful in 
							terms of sonority.
						</p>
